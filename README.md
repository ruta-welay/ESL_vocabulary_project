## Project Files 



* app.py -main application script 
* ESL\_vocabulary.csv - dataset of vocabulary words
* esl\_vocab\_classfier.ipynb - notebook with classifier code 



## How to Use 



1. Open esl\_vocab\_classifier.ipynb in Jupyter notebook. 
2. Run the cells to train or test the vocabulary classifier. 
3. Use app.py to interact witht he model in a simple interface. 



Notes 

The ('esl\_vocab\_model.pkl') is not included in GitHub to save space . You can train your own model using the notebook.
