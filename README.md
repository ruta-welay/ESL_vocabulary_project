# ESL Vocabulary Project



An AI-driven language learning platform designed to make high-quality English education accessible to low-income and underserved learners. 



This project began as an ESL vocabulary level prediction tool and is evolving into an interactive learning assistant for academic and exam preparation(including IELTS and general English proficiency).



## Mission



To provide a free, intelligent, and interactive English learning tool for students who cannot afford paid language learning platforms. The goal is to combine AI and language learning to reduce barriers and support learners. 



## Current Version (Phase 1)



The current implementation includes :

* Vocabular CEFR level prediction
* Feature-based linguistic analysis:(word length, vowel count, syllable count) 
* Machine learning model: RandomForestClassifier(scikit-learn)
* Streamlit-baseduse interface 



This serves as the foundational engine for future expansion. 



## Technology



* Python 
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Streamlit 
* Joblib





## Project Files



* app.py -main application script
* ESL\_vocabulary.csv - dataset of vocabulary words
* esl\_vocab\_classfier.ipynb - notebook with classifier code



## How to Use



1. Open esl\_vocab\_classifier.ipynb in Jupyter notebook.
2. Run the cells to train or test the vocabulary classifier.
3. Use app.py to interact witht he model in a simple interface.



Notes

The ('esl\_vocab\_model.pkl') is not included in GitHub to save space . You can train your own model using the notebook.



## Potential Extensions



This project is designed to evolve into a full AI-powered interactive language learning platform.



* Advanced Vocabulary Intelligence: CEFR base vocabulary database
* Writing feedback system: essay and paragraph analysis, grammar pattern detection, and sentence complexity analysis.
* Speaking practice simulator, including interactive speaking prompts, vocabulary usage feedback, and fluency analysis.
* personalized learning path generator by assessing current level





## Long-Term Vision



To develop an AI-supported educational platform that bridges the gap between high-cost language preparation and learning tools and students who lack financial means. 



This project represents the early foundation of the broader vision.
